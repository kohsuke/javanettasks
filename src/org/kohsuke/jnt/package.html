The library that exposes programatic manipulation of java.net.

<p>
This library wraps the web interface of java.net so that you can
programatically access java.net to perform some tasks.

<p>
A typical usage of this library would look like the following:

<pre>
// connect to java.net
JavaNet connection = {@link JavaNet}.connect(...);

// then perform some tasks
JNProject project = connection.getProject("jaxb");
projects.getForums().createForum("test","creating a new forum with the java.net tasks");
</pre>

<p>
The first thing you need to do is to connect to java.net.
When you connect, you need to specify your username and password
in one way or another.
The various connect methods
let you provide these information in different ways.
The credentials of the user account determines what you can do.

<p>
Once you get a {@link JavaNet} object, you can access it
just like any other object model. In the above example,
it's creating a new forum in the JAXB project.

<h3>Error Handling</h3>
<p>
Because most of this API relies heavily on HTML scraping and remote access,
there's inherently a risk of errors. All the errors this API encouners
are thrown as {@link ProcessingException}.
