<section name="Scripting java.net tasks with Groovy">
  <p>
  	The java.net tasks library exposes a Java API for accessing java.net functionalities. While it comes with a few tools and ant tasks, often you need to do things that are bit more complicated.
  </p>
  <p>
  	One way to do these things easily is to use a scripting language like <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/">Groovy</a>. In particular, I found it quite useful to write a script by using Groovy as described in <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Running">this document</a>.
  </p>
<source>
#!/usr/bin/env groovy -cp lib/javanettasks.jar
import org.kohsuke.jnt.*;

con = JavaNet.connect();

System.out.println("My projects:");
for( p : con.getMyself().getMyProjects() )
  System.out.println(p.getName());
</source>
	<p>
		By doing <code>chmod u+x script.groovy</code>, you can execute this file just like a shell script.
	</p><p>
    The similar approach should work with any scripting languages for Java, such as BeanShell.
