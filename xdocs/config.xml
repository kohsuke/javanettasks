	<p>
		Most of the Ant tasks and tools require your user name and password to work correctly. Since specifying this information each time you invoke a tool/ant task is tedious and insecure, you can write that information in <tt>~/.java.net</tt> like this:
	</p>
<source>
userName=kohsuke
password=mypassword
proxyServer=proxy.acme.com
proxyPort=8080
</source>
	<p>
		<tt>proxyServer</tt> and <tt>proxyPort</tt> are optional (but you have to have both if you want to use a proxy.) All the tools and Ant tasks will try to read this file.
	</p><p>
		On Windows, try running a tool without this file and see the error message to find out where you should place this file.
	</p><p>
		Make sure to set the permission to 600 to protect your information.
