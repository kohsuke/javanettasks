<section name="What's this?">
<p>
	In java.net, a person with the observer role can post a bug report but he cannot add comments / attachments to a bug. While managing a project, I noticed that this causes a lot of confusion among bug submitters.
</p><p>
	This tool eases the pain by automatically granting a certain role to everyone who submits a bug. Typically, this role will have the "modify issues" permission.
</p>
</section>
<section name="How to use">
<p>
	Run the program as follows:
</p><pre><![CDATA[
$ java -jar javaNetTasks.jar grantRoleForBugReporter [projectName] [roleName] &lt; email
]]></pre>
<p>
	This tool is really useful in conjunction with procmail. You add the following  piece to your recipe:
</p>
<pre>
:0 c
* ^Subject:  \[Issue [0-9]+\] New .*
* ^To: issues@jaxb.dev.java.net
| java -jar ....
</pre>
<p>
	Note that you need two whitespaces in the <tt>Subject</tt> test line (between "Subject:" and "\[Issue".) With this set up, as soon as someone posts a new bug, he gets the new role immediately.
